# OCR
- The primary objective is to speed up the process of character recognition in document processing. As a result the system can process a huge number of documents with-in less time and hence saves the time. 
- Since our character recognition is based on a grid infrastructure, it aims to recognize multiple heterogeneous characters that belong to different universal languages with different font properties and alignments.

**Note**: It involves the use of python language to recognise the characters (single digit numbers) using artificial intelligence concepts to provide 90% of accurate results.

## Doc
Contains the project report for in-depth understanding of the OCR system.

## Images
The `Images` directory constitutes of 2 sub-directories:
    
    1. *training_datasets*: Contains the image that is used to train our system.
    
    2. *sample_datasets*: Contains the images of hand-written characters which we want to run against our system.
